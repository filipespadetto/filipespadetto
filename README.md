## Curiosities about me
- I started to play drums ü•Å at church since my 6y. I already play with many bands and many people in many different places, but in 2017 I decided to change my career and start in technology. In the same year I participated at the Samsung e-Festival contest, what I composed an instrumental song less than 30 days. You can watch the drum playthrough [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvZIgFkGLjc).
